I'm an imbecile with access to VS Code and a SSH server.
I usually make stupid stuff, like [MagicPacketSSH](https://github.com/airime80/magicpacketssh) or [KATiA](https://github.com/airime80/KATiA)

Most of those things have a lot hard coded in them, since they're just prototypes.
MagicPacketSSH and KATiA aren't finished yet.
